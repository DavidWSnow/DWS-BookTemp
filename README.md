DWS Book Templates
==================

When I started writing an eBook with LibreOffice Writer I could not find
a template that worked and demonstrated the styles used within the
template, so I created two.

What's Included
---------------

1.  LibreOffice Writer templates for both a novel and light technical
    books containing a style sheet and sample content for a book.

2.  A step-by-step set of instructions (DWS-BookTemp-Instructions.pdf)
    for:

    a.  Setting up the environment on Mac or Windows PC.
    b.  Starting a book project and producing a PDF file for viewing and
        printing on US letter (8.5″ x 11″) paper, and an EPUB 3 for
        viewing and submitting to Amazon.
    c.  Creating both the JPEG cover for an eBook and a PDF file for the
        front cover, back cover and spine of a paperback book.
    d.  Final post processing for paperback printing.
    e.  Producing an EPUB 3 file for viewing and submitting to book
        distributors.

3.  A LibreOffice Calc Worksheet to calculate the dimensions for a
    paperback cover. (DWS-Book-Calc.ods).

Files Included
--------------

-   DWS-BookTempNovel in EPUB 3, PDF and ODT source (\~45 pages)
-   DWS-BookTempTech in PDF and ODT source (\~50 pages)
-   DWS-BookTemp-Instructions in PDF (\~30 pages)
-   Calc/DWS-BookCalc.ods a worksheet
-   CoverArt/DWS-BookTemp.aphoto (8.8MB)

There are PDF and EPUB versions of DWS-BookTempNovel included in this
repository so that you can see how a sample Novel would be formatted as
a paperback or on a eBook.

Getting Started
---------------

The file **DWS-BookTemp-Instructions.pdf **contains the instructions
for:

-   Software Installation on macOS & Windows
-   New Book Project Setup---The instructions to process the template
    into a paperback, EPUB3 and Kindle MOBI files.
-   Post Processing Steps---The final steps prior to producing an eBook
    or paperback.
-   Creating both an eBook cover and a paperback book cover.

Prerequisites
-------------

None

Installing
----------

-   See **DWS-BookTemp-Instructions.pdf**
-   Most directories have a **README.pdf **file to describe what they
    include.

Running the tests
-----------------

If you follow the example in the instructions, you will have a sample
8.5x11" paperback, a Kindle and EPUB3 eBook built using the template
(**DWS-BookTempNovel.odt**) as a test showing each of the named style
elements. **DWS-BookTemp_Epub3.epub **is what the eBook will look like.
You can view this in any EPUB reader, including Amazon's Kindle
Previewer.

You can follow the same instructions using the DWS-BookTempTech template
and get an example from the light technical template.

Versioning
----------

LibreOffice Writer isn't a good format for version control. However,
each file contains a date-formatted version ID near the top of the file
similar to the two lines below.
