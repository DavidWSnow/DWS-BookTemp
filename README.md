DWS Book Templates
==================

When I started writing an eBook with LibreOffice Writer I could not find
a template that worked and demonstrated the styles used within the
template, so I created two.

What's Included
---------------

1.  LibreOffice Writer templates for both a novel and light technical
    books containing a style sheet and sample content for a book.

2.  A step-by-step set of instructions (DWS-BookTemp-Instructions.pdf)
    for:

    a.  Setting up the environment on Mac or Windows PC.
    b.  Starting a book project and producing a PDF file for viewing and
        printing on US letter (8.5″ x 11″) paper, and an EPUB 3 for
        viewing and submitting to Amazon. **Note:** Amazon now wants
        EPUB files for submission!
    c.  Creating both the JPEG cover for an eBook and a PDF file for the
        front cover, back cover and spine of a paperback book.
    d.  Final post processing for paperback printing.
    e.  Producing an EPUB 3 file for viewing and submitting to book
        distributors.

3.  A LibreOffice Calc Worksheet to calculate the dimensions for a
    paperback cover. (DWS-Book-Calc.ods).

Files Included
--------------

-   DWS-BookTempNovel in EPUB 3, PDF and ODT source (\~50 pages)
-   DWS-BookTempTech in EPUB 3, PDF and ODT source (\~60 pages)
-   DWS-BookTemp-Instructions in PDF (\~35 pages)
-   Calc/DWS-BookCalc.ods (a worksheet)

There are ODT, PDF and EPUB versions of DWS-BookTempNovel and
DWS-BookTempTech included in this repository so that you can see how a
sample book would be formatted as a paperback or an eBook.

Getting Started
---------------

****W****arning: ****When viewing PDF files at GitHub, hyperlinks and
links in the Table of Contents ***may*** not be clickable! In the actual
PDF files, when downloaded they are.

The file **DWS-BookTemp-Instructions.pdf **contains the instructions
for:

-   Software Installation on macOS & Windows
-   New Book Project Setup---The instructions to process the template
    into a paperback, EPUB3 and Kindle MOBI files. Note: Most of these
    have been moved to the template.
-   Post Processing Steps---The final steps prior to producing an eBook
    or paperback.
-   Creating both an eBook cover and a paperback book cover.
-   Other useful stuff.

Prerequisites
-------------

None

Installing
----------

-   See **DWS-BookTemp-Instructions.pdf**
-   Most directories have a **README.pdf **file to describe what they
    include.

Running the tests
-----------------

If you follow the example in the instructions, you will have a sample
8.5x11ʺ paperback, an EPUB 3 eBook built using the template
(**DWS-BookTempNovel.odt**) as a test. Each showing the named style
elements. **DWS-BookTempNovel\_Epub3.epub **is what the novel will look
like. You can view this in any EPUB reader, including Amazon's Kindle
Previewer.

You can follow the same instructions using the DWS-BookTempTech template
and get an example from the light technical template.
**DWS-BookTempTech\_Epub3.epub **is now included in the repository.

Versioning
----------

LibreOffice Writer isn't a good format for version control. However,
each file contains a date-formatted version ID near the top of the file
similar to the two lines below.

**File:** README.odt **Title**: README.odt **Author:** David Snow
